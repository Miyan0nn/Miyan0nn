### 🧑🏻‍💻 About Me :
- 👋 Hello! I'm Yining (ee-nin) Qian, a proud graduate from the University of Texas at Austin 🤘🏻, where I earned a Master's in Marketing and a Bachelor's in Economics. I'm an outdoor enthusiast, a bassist, a digital native, and a problem solver. On the side, you might find me in the streets capturing decisive moments as a freelance photographer, or deep into nature documenting landscapes and portraits.
- 💻 Equipped with over three years of experience in the dynamic world of marketing, I've dived into everything from marketing analytics and market research to digital marketing. These have been integral parts of my master's program and my internships, nurturing my passion as a data-driven marketer.
- 🛠️ Throughout my journey,  I've sharpened a diverse set of skills including data analysis and visualization, marketing mix modeling, search engine optimization, qualitative research, consumer insights, user experience, and so much more. I'm well-versed with indispensable tools like Python, R, SQL, Excel, Tableau, Google Analytics, Hubspot, and Adobe Suite, among others. My curiosity also leads me to explore the potential of novel marketing aids, such as ChatGPT.
- 📫 I am currently looking for full-time Marketing Analytics positions based in Austin, TX. If you think we could make magic happen together, or if you just want to chat about anything about hiking trails around Austin, my band, or my photographs, feel free to connect with me at [![Linkedin Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-YiningQian-blue?style=flat&logo=Linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/qianyining/).
- 🙌🏻 Thanks for landing here. Wish you a wonderful day!
